These are the files for the course project for the JHU/Coursera Getting & Cleaning Data.

run_analysis.R	The main analysis file for this project. (See below for more information)
codebook.md		An attempt at a codebook for the variables found in run_analysis.R
UCI HAR Dataset		A folder containing the data, originally from http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
means.txt		The output of run_analysis.r - a tidy data set.

From the original problem statement:
 
 You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:
     
 1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
 3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
 5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
